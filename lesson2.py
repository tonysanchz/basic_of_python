age = 20
#declare variable age. age here is the name of the variable and 20 is the value of that variable
hello_name = "Mosh"
#hello_name is the name of the variable "Mosh" is the value of the variable. The variable must be in parentheses with a literal value or the code will fail!
print(age, hello_name)
#print here still opens () normally but cannot have double quotes or single quotes because if you do so, the machine will understand that you want to print out age or hello_name
#age or hello_name here is the variable name that you have declared. It will automatically understand and write to the screen the value of the previously declared variable
