name = input("what is your name? ")
# name here is when we have declared name as input when doing so the machine will understand that iput is equal to name so wherever there is input we can replace it with name because we have declared before that name = input
# when running the above command it will show what your name and there will be a place for it to ask us to enter our name
print("hello, "+ name)
# this code will work as follows, it will print the word hello, then after dos is the variable name that was declared before and got data from the user and then it will print hello, tony if I enter the name tony in what is your name
